== Message payloads ==

All message payloads are encrypted using ratcheting.

Regular message:

{
	"m": message contents
}

Image message:

{
	"i": {
		"i": image file id,
		"w": image width,
		"h": image height,
		"ti": thumbnail file id,
		"tw": thumbnail width,
		"th": thumbnail height
	},
	"k": Encryption key
}

Video message:

{
	"v": {
		"v": video file id,
		"ti": thumbnail file id,
		"tw": thumbnail width,
		"th": thumbnail height
	},
	"k": Encryption key
}

All messages are wrapped using the following JSON before being sent to the backend.

{
	"t": "m",
	"r": recipient id (as a String),
	"i": The id of this message,
	"m": {
		"k": The public key of this user,
		"c": The message number in this conversation,
		"m": The encrypted message
	}
}

To support group chats, how about sending something like this:

{
	"t": "m",
	"i": The id of this message,
	"r": [{
			"r": recipient id,
			"k": the public key of this user,
			"c": the message number in this conversation,
			"k": The key used to encrypt the message which has been encrypted using the ratcheting protocol
		}],
	"m": The message encrypted using the key sent to each user
}

Inside the actual message we'd include a field such as:

{
	"g": [user ids]	
}

Which includes the ids of all users in this group chat.
